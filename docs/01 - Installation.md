#Installation

##Prerequisites
All tips in this doc are related to Ubuntu 12.04. If you use less popular OS, it's up to you to do all this stuff below.

You will need **git**. If you don't have git, just install it with the packet manager

    sudo apt-get install git

----------

##Install OpenCV from sources

We will need openCV. Offsite instructions are to build it from source.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev python-dev python-numpy libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev
        
Download sources. You can do it with wget, but the source is stored on SourceForge which has it's own handler for downloads. It's much easier to download it with your favorite browser and put to server via sftp client. Get your copy [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip/download). I put mine into /var/opt/src/OpenCV.
    
   It's compile time.
    
    cd /var/opt/src/OpenCV
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
    
If configure was ok, run
    
    make
    sudo make install
    
This will take... a while.

**[Optional]**. Probably your ldconfig already know about `/usr/local/lib`, but if you get message that dynamic library is not found, put 
    
    /usr/local/lib
    
to /etc/ld.so.conf and update binding:
    
    sudo ldconfig

----------

## Install FreeImage

FreeImage library provide support for huge list of input/output image formats, including WEBP, TIFF and GIF (with **animation support**). If you don't need this, just comment out _IMP\_FEATURE\_ADVANCED\_IO_ flag in top of required.h file and skip this section. Without FreeImage IMP restricted to OpenCV codec, and therefore has support only for JPEG and PNG.

#### Through packet manager

Before you go, there is **huge caveat**: it probably will install 3.15.x version of library. WEBP therefore will be unavailable. (Official site also says: _It (v3.16) also provides better support for RAW, JPEG-2000, BMP, SGI, ICO, PSD, TIFF, TGA, GIF formats_).

If you ok with this, just run

    sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev

or use packet manager provided by your OS. Otherwise go to next header.

#### From source

1. Go to http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html and copy link to source. Let's say it http://downloads.sourceforge.net/freeimage/FreeImage3160.zip
2. Download and unpack it.

        cd /var/opt/src
        wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/freeimage/FreeImage3160.zip
        unzip FreeImage3160.zip

3. Compile and install

        cd FreeImage
        make
        sudo make install



----------

##Get nginx sources
    
    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/nginx/nginx.git

**[Optional].** You can download `pcre`, `openssh` and/or `zlib`. It used for some nginx features, but it not necessary if you build IMP-enabled nginx to separated service. As for me, I downloaded `pcre`.

----------

##Get IMP sources

    git clone https://github.com/tommiv/ngx_http_imgproc.git

----------

##It's build time

I assume you still in `/var/opt/src` and you have all needed sources here: nginx, optional pcre|libssh|zlib and IMP.
        
    cd nginx
    
Write configure line for nginx
        
    ./configure \
        --prefix=/var/opt/bin/nginx-imp \
        --sbin-path=./ \
        --conf-path=./conf/nginx.conf \
        --pid-path=./nginx.pid \
        --without-http_rewrite_module \
        --add-module=../ngx_http_imgproc
    
You can just copy/paste it if `/var/opt/bin/nginx-imp` binary path is ok for you. If you downloaded any additional libs like zlib, you can add it to configure command, as described [here](http://wiki.nginx.org/InstallOptions).

Wait until configure is finished. If you don't see "error" word, all is ok.
    
Now is your chance. Type

    make
    
If you lucky enough, you'll see compiler message about all is complete. Check for it:
        
    objs/nginx
    
You'll see message about not found log and config files. It's ok, proceed to configuration step. 
    
If you see "not found" message, compilation was unsuccessful. 
    
If you see `libdc1394 error: Failed to initialize libdc1394` â€“ don't worry too much. This is not an error actually, it's warning. I wasn't able to found easy fix for this, but it have no any consequences, it's just annoying.

----------

##Put binary where it belong

Make dirs. Copy nginx binary and config stub to working directory

    mkdir /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp
    mkdir /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/conf
    mkdir /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/logs
    cp objs/nginx /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/
    cp conf/* /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/conf
    
We're done here. You can go to destination folder

    cd /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp

and start to configure service.

----------
##[Optional] Add IMP to upstart

Based on <s>actual events</s> [this article](http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/10/17/ubuntu-lts-adding-an-nginx-init-script).

If you used same binary path as me, just put `/docs/nginx-imp` script to `/etc/init.d/`. Otherwise open it first and modify DAEMON and PIDFILE variables on lines 15-16 to your own.

Make script executable

    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx-imp
    
Update run levels

    sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx-imp defaults
    
That's all, now you can use

    service nginx-imp start
    service nginx-imp stop
    service nginx-imp reload
    
to control IMP.

If you don't want to this crazy stuff, you can run IMP with

    /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/nginx
    
And stop/restart with signal send

    /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/nginx -s %signal%
    i.e.
    /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/nginx -s stop

----------

##Update/rebuild

Pull new nginx and/or IMP sources

    cd /var/opt/src/nginx
    git pull origin master
    
    cd /var/opt/src/ngx_http_imgproc
    git pull origin master
    
Run make inside 
    
    cd /var/opt/src/nginx
    make

If you'll see errors, try to re-run `./configure` as described in **It's build time** section and run `make` again.

Replace binary
    
    service nginx-imp stop
    cp objs/nginx /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/
    service nginx-imp start
    

----------

##Run inside docker
There's no prepared image, but it's definetely possible to build it. Here is sample of how it could work, but you'll probably will want to modify paths/ips/configs etc.

0. Install docker if needed

        sudo apt-get install docker.io
    
1. Go to nginx source folder and create folder for docker files

        cd /var/opt/src/nginx
        mkdir docker && cd docker

2. Create build.sh file with this content:

        #! /bin/sh

        cp ../objs/nginx .
        cp /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.2.4 .
        cp /usr/local/lib/libopencv_imgproc.so.2.4 .
        cp /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.so.2.4 .
        cp /usr/lib/libfreeimage.so.3 .
        mkdir -p /etc/nginx-imp/conf
        mkdir -p /etc/nginx-imp/logs
        cp -f ../conf/* /etc/nginx-imp/conf
        
        docker.io build -t nginx_imp .
    
    **Important**: building openCV, FreeImage and nginx itself inside docker is too complex, slow and also leads to too big docker image, so we just copy pre-built libs and executable to image. However, code above assumes that openCV is 2.4.x branch and FreeImage is 3.x branch and both libs built from sources as it described in this manual. It's up to you to check if this libs really exists on its places. Note you can use `readelf -d nginx | grep NEEDED` to get list of dynamic libs required by nginx-imp executable.

3. Create Dockerfile with this content:

        FROM ubuntu
        MAINTAINER John Doe <john@example.com>
        
        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgtk2.0-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev
        
        COPY nginx /var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/nginx
        COPY libopencv_core.so.2.4 /usr/lib/libopencv_core.so.2.4
        COPY libopencv_imgproc.so.2.4 /usr/lib/libopencv_imgproc.so.2.4
        COPY libopencv_highgui.so.2.4 /usr/lib/libopencv_highgui.so.2.4
        COPY libfreeimage.so.3 /usr/lib/libfreeimage.so.3
        
        CMD ["/var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/nginx"]
        EXPOSE 80
        
4. Build image with

        chmod +x build.sh
        ./build.sh
        
5. If build was ok, you need to edit /etc/nginx-imp/conf/nginx.conf and put `daemon off` directive to it. It's really important since docker will close container if nginx daemonize itself.

6. Finally, you can run container

        docker run -d \
        -p 127.0.0.10:80:80 \
        -v /etc/nginx-imp/conf:/var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/conf \
        -v /etc/nginx-imp/logs:/var/opt/bin/nginx-imp/logs \
        -v /var/www/imp:/var/www \
        nginx_imp
        
    Here we set explicit IP, mount volumes from host to container with config and logs, and also www folder. Of course you can change paths as you wish. Remove `-d` key to view emerge nginx alerts if something went wrong. If no errors were thrown, check `docker ps` to ensure container is still running. If so, you can put any image to host `/var/www/imp` and try to process it: `curl 127.0.0.10/test.jpg?resize=16` (sorry, this will flood your terminal with unreadable binary data).
